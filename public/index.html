                    You have been awakened from cryogenic sleep on a spaceship headed for Earth. The ship's semi-autonomous, intelligent computer system, HAL, needs your decision-making skills to guide the ship safely back to Earth before it's too late.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your mission is to work with HAL to get back to Earth on time. HAL will interact with you, answer your questions, and follow your orders. You approach a nearby terminal. Follow the instructions below to boot up HAL and begin your mission!
